# Web Tools

A collection of simple, standalone HTML tools for everyday tasks. Each tool is a single HTML file with no build process required.

Inspired by [Simon Willison's tools](https://github.com/simonw/tools). See also *[Useful patterns for building HTML tools](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/10/html-tools/)*.
